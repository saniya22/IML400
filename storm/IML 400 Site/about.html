				<p>“The turtle totem wisdom teaches us about walking our path in peace and sticking to it with determination and serenity. Slow moving on earth, yet also incredibly fast and agile in water, those who have the turtle as totem or spirit animal may be encouraged to take a break in their busy lives and look around or within themselves for more grounded, long-lasting solutions. Traditionally, the turtle is symbolic of the way of peace, whether it’s inviting us to cultivate peace of mind or a peaceful relationship with our environment.”</p>

				<p>Parts of what my spirit animal is symbolizing are definitely accurate, like the need to slow down so I don’t overwhelm myself with a bunch of things. Also my incessant need to dissect anything and everything before making a decision. Other parts like being naturally tuned to the elements, lands, plants, people and animals I haven’t experienced as much though, being able to talk to animals would be AWESOME.</p>

				<p>I’m taking this class because I really enjoyed the way web design can challenge you. You might end up being frustrated for hours after scouring Google trying to find a solution to your problem, but the satisfaction in the end makes it worth it. I liked that experience and it only seemed natural to continue the progression in learning about the Web in IML 400. What I hope to accomplish in this class is to get the basics about the structure of the Web understood, so later even if I do wish to pursue this further I can be of better help in teaching myself.</p>
